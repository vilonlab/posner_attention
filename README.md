# posner_attention
collaboration with Dr Andrew Lynn, using psychopy &amp; quest+

## `ViLoN_Posner_Cueing.py` Breakdown:

### Setting up, Imports
For setting up your library, I think the process is pretty straight forward, you need:
```python
pip install psychopy
pip install numpy
pip install questplus
```
> I can't remember if questplus comes with psychopy, it might.

### Significant sections, Line-by-Line

*Line 38*: Initialize QuestPlus Algorithm

This sets up 

*Line 380-384* Parameters for the stimuli

I wanted to make it so that we could change the size, position, and spatial frequency of the gabor stimuli by just changing these values.
